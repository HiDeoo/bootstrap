It can be embedded in a basic string once [[param:icons]], twice [[param:icons]], and also with markup, e.g. **[[param:icons]]** or _test [[param:icons]] test_.

###### In a heading [[param:icons]] maybe?

- Replaced chevron icons for carousel controls with new SVGs from [Bootstrap [[param:docs_version]] Icons]([[param:icons]]).

<div class="bd-brand-item px-2 py-5 mb-3 border rounded-3">
  <img
    class="d-block img-fluid mx-auto"
    src="/docs/[[param:docs_version]]/assets/brand/bootstrap-logo.svg"
    alt="Bootstrap"
    width="10"
    height="10"
  />
</div>

<span class="d-block mb-3">[[param:docs_version]]</span>

The full Bootstrap license is located [in the project repository]([[param:repo]]/blob/v[[param:current_version]]/LICENSE) for more information.

Originally [released](https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/a/2011/bootstrap-twitter.html) on <time datetime="2011-08-19 11:25">Friday, August 19, 2011</time>, we've since had over [twenty releases]([[param:repo]]/releases), including two major rewrites with v2 and v3. With Bootstrap 2, we added responsive functionality to the entire framework as an optional stylesheet. Building on that with Bootstrap 3, we rewrote the library once more to make it responsive by default with a mobile first approach.

This should also work while embedded in a `<BsTable />` component.

<BsTable class="table table-options">
| Variable | Values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$enable-container-classes` | `true` (default) or `false` | Enables the generation of CSS classes for layout containers. (New in v[[param:docs_version]]) |
</BsTable>
