## Quick start

Get started by including Bootstrap's production-ready CSS and JavaScript via CDN without the need for any build steps. See it in practice with this [Bootstrap CodePen demo](https://codepen.io/team/bootstrap/pen/qBamdLj).

<br/>

1. **Create a new `index.html` file in your project root.** Include the `<meta name="viewport">` tag as well for [proper responsive behavior](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag) in mobile devices.

   ```html
   <!doctype html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="utf-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
       <title>Bootstrap demo</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

2. **Include Bootstrap's CSS and JS.** Place the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` for our CSS, and the `<script>` tag for our JavaScript bundle (including Popper for positioning dropdowns, poppers, and tooltips) before the closing `</body>`. Learn more about our [CDN links](#cdn-links).

   ```html
   <!doctype html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="utf-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
       <title>Bootstrap demo</title>
       <link href="[[param:cdn.css]]" rel="stylesheet" integrity="[[param:cdn.css_hash]]" crossorigin="anonymous">
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
       <script src="[[param:cdn.js_bundle]]" integrity="[[param:cdn.js_bundle_hash]]" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

   You can also include [Popper](https://popper.js.org/) and our JS separately. If you don't plan to use dropdowns, popovers, or tooltips, save some kilobytes by not including Popper.

   ```html
   <script src="[[param:cdn.popper]]" integrity="[[param:cdn.popper_hash]]" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
   <script src="[[param:cdn.js]]" integrity="[[param:cdn.js_hash]]" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
   ```
